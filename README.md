## Part 2: Advertising 
  AVG Profit Per State (worksheet)
I needed to find the top three states with highest average profit. The chart shows the top profit earning states in descending order.
  Month and States to Advertise In (worksheet)
I created a calculated field allowing advertisement cost to be 20% of the profit for the top three highest earning states and the highest earning month of those states.The visuliation shows the three most profitable states in the best month of the year.

## Part 3: Returned Items
After left joing the returns table with the orders table and creating a calculated field where the null values are 0 and the 'Yes' values are 1, I could answer further questions.
  Products With High Return Rates (worksheet)
This visualization shows the most returned Product IDs in descending order.
  Customers With High Return Rates (worksheet)
This visualization shows the Customer IDs with the most returns in descending order.
